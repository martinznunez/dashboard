# Real-Time Data Application with WebSockets

This React application is designed to enable real-time communication with a server using WebSockets, allowing for the seamless updating and rendering of data. In technical terms, the application actively utilizes WebSockets to receive real-time data, persist it within a state, and dynamically render it on cards. Additionally, it empowers users to modify the application state and transmit these changes back to the server. The user interface also provides the convenience of controlling cards through the use of a switch.
